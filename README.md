# Modeling-and-visualization-of-high-dimensional-data
This is the second work for the modeling and high dimensional data, whixh is the work for 1-D SOM(self-organizing mapping) and 2-D,
after finish the implementation and application for the 2D and 3D SOM. 
we need to the second is the Image clustering with SOM. This second part in this cousework means that we should use the SOM-Toolbox
to analysis the images to get the better clusters by SOM. Here, we first to obtain the U-matrix(Unified distance matrix), which is the
represent the clusters in the plot by use the different colors, the deep colors like red in U-matrix means the long distance, and the 
dark blue means the short distance. The best implementation is that in U-matrix, we can clear see that the different clusters in it,
such as the cluster is the most blue pixels together, and the red-boundrary can classifier them.
The third part is to add RGB histagrma and RGB area to get the 5 kinds of feature extraction, and to get the RGB U-matrix, because we 
get more features that means we can get more informations than part2, that is why we can get the better images clustering.
